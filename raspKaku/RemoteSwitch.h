/**
* RemoteSwitch provides a generic class for simulation of common RF remote controls, like the 'Klik aan Klik uit'-system 
* (http://www.klikaanklikuit.nl/), used to remotely switch lights etc.
*
* Many of these remotes seem to use a 433MHz SAW resonator and one of these chips: LP801B,  HX2262, PT2262, M3E.
* Datasheet for the HX2262/PT2262 ICs:
* http://www.princeton.com.tw/downloadprocess/downloadfile.asp?mydownload=PT2262_1.pdf
*
* Hardware required for this library: a 433MHz SAW oscillator transmitter, e.g.
* http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=7815
* http://www.conrad.nl/goto/?product=130428
*
* Notes:
* - Since these chips use (and send!) tri-state inputs (low, high and floating) I use 'trits' instead of 'bits',
*   when appropriate.
* - I measured the period lengths with a scope.  Thus: they work for my remotes, but may fail for yours...
*   A better way would be to calculate the 'target'-timings using the  datasheets and the resistor-values on the remotes.
